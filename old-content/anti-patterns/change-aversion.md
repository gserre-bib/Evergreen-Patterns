It is a conviction: do not evolve, improve, or change anything in a system because it works. 
*if it's working don't fix it* 
We now know that the result is an illusion. 
 
 
The system is living and needs regular attention: 
- to adapt it to the reality of business volumes 
-	to update it regularly in terms of security and obsolescence 
-	to modify the components that have defects 
-	to adapt the system to regulatory requirements 
-	to improve its operability based on RCAs, PRB, and feedbacks 
-	â€¦. 
-
  
We can see that doing nothing can bring stability over time, but it accumulates the actions necessary for the successful operation of the system over time. And so the teams consciously or unconsciously do everything to avoid any change for fear of risk at all costs. 
 
 
With time it becomes necessary to push in production all these changes accumulated. At this time: 
-	the risk is more important because we deliver in one time an important number of updates. 
-	the risk of bug or regression is more important, and more complex to identify in the mass.
