## Evergreen Pattern: Event Management

**Description:** My systems send notifications as soon as possible when situations arise so I can react quickly (often referred simply, "Events are managed properly").  This is aligned with ITIL service desk best practice for event logging and escalation procedures where the intent focusses on maintaining high quality of services.
    * For example: If there has been a server outage at 12pm it will send out an immediate notification to all team members, so that action can be taken quickly as possible after initial diagnosis by system administrator(s).

**Key Principles:**  This Evergreen pattern primarily revolves around the idea of sending notifications immeidiately when situations require intervention. This necessitates adopting a multilayered approach where systems are configured for specific event logging and escalation procedures to disseminate messages effectively across all team members, while ensuring proper incident management processes take place simultaneously as soon an issue emerges with potential service interruption impacts identified by system administrator(s).

**Benefits:**
* Rapidly identifies situations requiring action reducing mean time between failure (MTBF) unnecessarily.  Due primarily because responses are being initiated faster to mitigate any adverse effects on services and customers, arising from such problems quickly becoming apparent as soon systems start sending out alerts about potential service disruptions immediately after there has been a significant change in system state or specific event that warrants action by team members responsible for maintaining high quality of software solutions.
* Minimizes downtime experienced during situations involving interconnected global IT infrastructures where quick responses are critical to ensuring services continue operating normally, reducing any adverse effects on customers as soon potential service disruptions become apparent after being tagged properly with appropriate tags aligned perfectly within this Evergreen pattern structure (see Related Online Resources section below for specific tag references).

**Implementation Strategies:**
1. Enable centralized event management system(s)/software tooling solutions to simplify and ensure consistency in sending notifications across all systems, team member devices etc.<br>  This will provide a single point where potential situations are tagged properly with aligned tags reflective of Evergreen patterns structure while maintaining proper incident logging processes as part integral components for this Epid (Incident Management Repository) system.
2 Enable teams responsible mainly on software solutions to configure specific event management rules ensuring messages about significant changes in services being routed directly into team member applications and email systems, where potential service disruptions are tagged properly with appropriate tags reflective of Evergreen patterns structure aligned perfectly within the Replay function item for this Epid (Incident Management Repository) system.
3 Cultivate a standardized way involving all software teams to tag specific situations accurately using predefined cascading nature event management tooling solutions employed by ITIL best practices as part integral components ensuring messages about potential service disruptions are tagged properly with appropriate tags reflective of Evergreen patterns structure aligned perfectly within Replay function item for Epid (Incident Management Repository) system.
