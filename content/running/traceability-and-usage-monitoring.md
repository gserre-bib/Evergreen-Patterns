## Traceability And Usage Monitoring Pattern

###Description:  A software system exhibits tractability when its internal workings are clearly understood while being easily customizable for specific usage scenarios, ensuring high quality service delivery and cost effectiveness across various customers with differing needs.<br>



***Key Principles:**    <li>- Harness Observational Logging
 <LI ;- Context Traceability Through Metrics Collection.

###Benefits:  A software system is easier to debug because its internal operations are clearly documented by logs that provide insightful information about user behaviour, potential faults and any anomalies arising during operation ensuring quick fixes for service disruptions.<br>



***Implementation Strategies:**    <li>- Design Systems For Observational Logging
 <LI ;- Weave Context Traceability Through Metrics Collection.
