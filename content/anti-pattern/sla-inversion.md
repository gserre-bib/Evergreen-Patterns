SLA Inversion: A Silent Killer of IT Systems
==============================================

The SLA Inversion anti-pattern describes the situation where the lowest system availability is determined by the availability of all its coupled dependencies. This means that if one of the dependent systems is down, the entire system is considered unavailable, even if the primary system is functioning properly. This can lead to significant problems in maintaining the desired level of service and meeting SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

Possible Mitigations:
-----------------------

To mitigate the effects of SLA Inversion, consider the following strategies:

* Modular design: Break down the system into smaller, independent components to reduce the impact of any single dependency.
* Redundancy and failover: Implement redundant components and failover mechanisms to ensure that the system remains available even if one or more dependencies are down.
* Load balancing: Distribute workloads across multiple instances or servers to minimize the impact of a single point of failure.
* SLA-based monitoring: Monitor the SLAs of all dependent systems and adjust the SLA of the primary system accordingly.

Problem Caused:
---------------

SLA Inversion can lead to significant problems, including:

* Unpredictable downtime: The unavailability of dependent systems can cause unexpected downtime for the primary system, leading to unhappy customers and lost revenue.
* Difficulty in meeting SLAs: The lowered availability of the dependent systems can make it challenging to meet the desired level of service, potentially leading to penalties or legal action.
* Increased support costs: SLA Inversion can result in a higher number of support incidents, increasing the cost of maintaining the system.
