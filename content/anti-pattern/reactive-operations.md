Reactive Operations: Driven by Incoming Incidents, Lacking Proactivity
=================================================================

The Reactive Operations anti-pattern describes a situation where IT operations are primarily driven by incoming incidents, rather than being proactive in identifying and addressing potential issues before they become incidents. This approach can lead to a never-ending cycle of firefighting, with little time or resources available for preventative maintenance or long-term planning.

Possible Mitigations:
-----------------------

1. Implement proactive monitoring and alerting: Set up monitoring tools to detect potential issues before they become incidents. This can include monitoring system logs, network traffic, and performance metrics.
2. Conduct regular maintenance and upgrades: Schedule regular maintenance windows and prioritize upgrades to address known vulnerabilities and improve system performance.
3. Establish a culture of prevention: Encourage IT staff to think proactively about potential issues and work to prevent them before they become incidents. This can include identifying and addressing potential bottlenecks, optimizing system configuration, and improving communication with stakeholders.
4. Implement incident management processes: Develop and implement effective incident management processes to ensure that incoming incidents are properly documented, investigated, and addressed.
5. Provide training and education: Offer regular training and education to IT staff on best practices for proactive operations, including incident management, monitoring, and maintenance.
