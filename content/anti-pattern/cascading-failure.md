The Cascading Failure anti-pattern describes a situation where failures of a system propagate to all its highly coupled third parties, resulting in a domino effect of failures that can bring down multiple systems and services. This phenomenon is often seen in complex, distributed systems where a failure in one component can have far-reaching consequences.

Description
------------

In a system with high coupling between components, a failure in one component can quickly spread to other components, causing a chain reaction of failures. This can happen when components are tightly integrated and rely on each other for functionality, making it difficult to isolate and resolve individual failures. As a result, a small failure in one component can escalate into a large-scale crisis that affects multiple systems and services.

Possible Mitigations
--------------------

To mitigate the effects of Cascading Failure, consider the following strategies:

1. **Loose Coupling**: Design components to be loosely coupled, so that they are not heavily reliant on each other for functionality. This can help prevent failures in one component from spreading to others.
2. **Modular Design**: Build systems with modular architecture, where components can be easily replaced or upgraded without affecting the entire system.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to detect and isolate failures quickly, preventing them from propagating to other components.
4. **Redundancy**: Incorporate redundancy into critical systems to ensure that if one component fails, others can take over its functions.
5. **Decentralization**: Distribute components across multiple servers or locations to reduce the risk of a single point of failure.
