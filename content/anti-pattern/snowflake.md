Snowflake Anti-Pattern
=====================

Description
------------

The Snowflake anti-pattern occurs when a system is built by accumulating numerous changes over time, resulting in a complex and non-reproducible architecture. This can lead to difficulties in understanding how the system works, making it challenging to maintain or debug.

Possible Mitigations
----------------------

To mitigate the Snowflake anti-pattern, consider the following strategies:

1. **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of the system's architecture and changes over time. This will help developers understand how the system works and make it easier to reproduce the system.
2. **Modular Design**: Break the system into smaller, independent components that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. This will reduce the complexity of the system and make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure that changes are thoroughly tested and deployed in a consistent manner. This will help prevent accumulation of changes and reduce the likelihood of introducing Snowflake-like complexity.

In this description, the Snowflake anti-pattern is defined as a system that has accumulated numerous changes over time and is not reproducible. The possible mitigations include documentation, modular design, and continuous integration and deployment. The tags are used to categorize the anti-pattern and make it easier to find related content.
