Snowball Effect
================

The Snowball Effect is an anti-pattern in which simple problems in IT systems grow bigger over time, leading to unmanageable situations. This phenomenon can occur due to a variety of factors, such as:

* Lack of attention to maintenance and upkeep: As systems are deployed and released, they may not receive the necessary attention to maintain their functionality and performance.
* Inadequate monitoring and logging: Without proper monitoring and logging, issues may go undetected until they become severe problems.
* Poor change management: Changes made to systems without proper testing and documentation can lead to unintended consequences and compounding issues.

Possible Mitigations
----------------------

To mitigate the Snowball Effect, consider the following strategies:

* Regular maintenance and upkeep: Schedule regular maintenance windows to address any issues before they become bigger problems.
* Implement adequate monitoring and logging: Use monitoring and logging tools to detect issues early and track their progression over time.
* Practice good change management: Test changes thoroughly before deploying them, and document all changes to ensure a clear understanding of the system's state.
