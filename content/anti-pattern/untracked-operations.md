Untracked Operations: A Silent Killer of Production Systems
=====================================================

The Untracked Operations anti-pattern describes a situation where some operations done on production systems are not tracked or auditable. This lack of visibility can lead to a range of problems, including:

* Difficulty in identifying and resolving issues
* Increased risk of errors and failures
* Limited ability to monitor and optimize system performance
* Inadequate security and compliance controls

Possible Mitigations:

* Implement a logging and monitoring solution to track all system activities and operations
* Use version control systems to maintain a record of all changes made to the system
* Enable auditing features in the operating system and applications to track user activity and system events
* Establish regular security and compliance audits to ensure adherence to policies and standards
