Normal Errors Anti-Pattern
=========================

The "Normal Errors" anti-pattern occurs when IT systems report an excessive number of errors, many of which are not relevant or not associated with any actual problems. This can lead to a variety of issues, including:

* Increased noise and distraction for system administrators and developers, making it more difficult to identify and address real problems.
* Overloading of logging and monitoring systems, leading to performance degradation and increased maintenance costs.
* Difficulty in identifying and diagnosing actual issues, as the sheer volume of errors can make it hard to distinguish between real and false positives.

Possible Mitigations:
----------------------

To mitigate the "Normal Errors" anti-pattern, consider the following strategies:

* Implement logging and monitoring systems that can filter out irrelevant errors and prioritize issues based on severity and impact.
* Use automated tools to analyze logs and identify patterns or trends that may indicate real problems.
* Regularly review and audit system logs to identify and address any unnecessary or redundant error reporting.
* Implement error handling and fallback strategies to minimize the impact of errors and prevent them from propagating through the system.
