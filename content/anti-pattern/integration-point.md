Integration Point Anti-Pattern
==========================

The Integration Point anti-pattern occurs when a system connects with another system, and inherits the failures and problems of the latter. This can lead to a cascade of issues, including:

* Increased complexity and difficulty in troubleshooting and maintaining the integrated systems.
* Decreased performance and reliability due to the added load and dependencies on the other system.
* Difficulty in isolating and resolving issues, as they may be hidden within the integration or the other system.

Possible Mitigations:

* Use loose coupling and abstraction to decouple the systems and reduce dependencies.
* Implement failover and fallback mechanisms to ensure that the system remains functional even if the other system fails.
* Use message queuing and buffering to absorb variability in the other system and prevent it from affecting the integrated system.
* Regularly review and update the integration points to ensure they are still necessary and functioning correctly.
