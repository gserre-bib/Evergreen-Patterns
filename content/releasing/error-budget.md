## Evergreen Pattern: Error Budget


**Description:**

This patterns advocates anticipating service level objective (SLO) violations as part of software system design processes with predefined consequences for said potential errors, ensuring high quality and disagreagility while maintaining cost effectiveness during operation phases.<br>  It is aligned perfectly to the Value Principle in SOLID Design principles.    
Implementation Strategies are typically achieved by adopting robust error budgets at all layers where services collaborate: application/API-, service bus -, system boundaries (Infrastructure as Code).

**Key Principles:**



1.** softshell Error Budgets sate potential violations during software design and not after production releases, ensuring zero defects rate prior to actual deployment. lila
2**. Consequency Model defines specific action plans when SLO are violated by outlining consequences for each error case such forced roll backs or service credits as appropriate actions depending on the nature of any particular issue at hand.<br>

**Benefits:**



1.** Minimizing potential software errors reducing production bug fixes and ensuring quality standards.
2**. Reagility, similability: Averting situations where systems become dysfunctional because there are no reserves for specific error scenarios in place during initial design is oke as it clearly defines consequences beforehand minimizing adverse effects on services being interrupted suddenly.<br>

**Implementation Strategies:**



1.** Design software architectures to anticipate potential errors by using robust patterns and techniques that minimize inherent flaws.
2**. softshell Error Budgets require outlining all possible situations where SLO are violated, detailing specific action plans for each case as part of the initial design process chaotically aligned with Value Principle.<br>
