Smoke Testing
================

Description
-----------

The Smoke Testing pattern is a software development best practice that involves automating critical functional tests to quickly validate the success of changes made to the system. This pattern helps teams ensure that their changes do not break the most critical functionality before they are released to production.

Key Principles
---------------

* Automate critical functional tests: The key principle of Smoke Testing is to automate critical functional tests that validate the most critical functionalities of the system. These tests should be fast and easy to run, and they should provide immediate feedback on whether the changes made to the system have broken any critical functionality.
* Early post-change validation: Smoke Testing should be done early in the development process, after changes have been made but before they are released to production. This allows teams to catch any issues early and avoid delivering broken software to users.
* Focus on critical functionalities: Smoke Testing should focus on validating the most critical functionalities of the system, rather than trying to test every possible scenario. This helps teams prioritize their testing efforts and ensure that they are testing the most important functionality.

Benefits
--------

* Improved quality: Smoke Testing helps teams ensure that their changes do not break critical functionality, which improves the overall quality of the system.
* Faster feedback: Smoke Testing provides immediate feedback on whether changes have broken critical functionality, allowing teams to catch issues early and avoid delays.
* Reduced risk: By validating critical functionalities early in the development process, Smoke Testing reduces the risk of delivering broken software to users.

Implementation Strategies
-------------------------

* Identify critical functionalities: Teams should identify the most critical functionalities of their system and prioritize testing those areas first.
* Automate tests: Teams should automate critical functional tests using tools such as Selenium or Cucumber.
* Run smoke tests early: Smoke Testing should be done early in the development process, after changes have been made but before they are released to production.
* Monitor results: Teams should monitor the results of smoke tests and take action if any critical functionality is found to be broken.
