Immutability
============

Description
------------

The Immutability pattern is a software development practice that emphasizes the importance of treating environment configurations as immutable, unchangeable assets. This means that each change to the environment is treated as a complete re-provisioning of the environment, ensuring that its configuration is 100% defined as code.

Key principles
---------------

* Treat environment configurations as immutable, unchangeable assets
* Each change is a complete re-provisioning of the environment
* Configuration is 100% defined as code

Benefits
--------

The Immutability pattern provides several benefits, including:

* Higher reliability and availability: By treating environment configurations as immutable, teams can ensure that their systems are always running with the correct configuration, reducing the risk of errors and downtime.
* Better scalability: With a complete re-provisioning of the environment for each change, teams can more easily scale their systems to meet changing demands.
* Improved security: By defining all configuration as code, teams can better control access to sensitive information and reduce the risk of unauthorized changes.

Implementation strategies
-------------------------

To implement the Immutability pattern, teams can follow these strategies:

* Use infrastructure as code tools: Teams should use infrastructure as code tools, such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, to define and manage their environment configurations.
* Treat environment variables as immutable: Teams should treat environment variables as immutable, avoiding changes to them whenever possible.
* Use version control for all configuration: Teams should use version control systems to track changes to their configuration files, ensuring that all changes are well-documented and reviewed.
